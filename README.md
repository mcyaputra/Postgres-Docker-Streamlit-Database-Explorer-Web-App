## Description

Containerised (Docker) interactive web application (Streamlit) built on Python to help users explore their data or tables. The web application helps user connects to a database (Postgres), allowing user to access and display the content of the database.

After successful connection, the web app will display:

1. Menu to connect to a database
2. Dropdown to select available tables in database
3. 5 tabs: Overall, Explore, Numeric, Text and Date

The 5 tabs containing information about the table selected are
Overall, Explore, Numeric, Text and Date tabs.

1.  ***Overall tab***: contains general overview of the dataset
    including number of rows and columns, table name,
    total duplicated rows and missing values. It also displays
    schema information such as data types and primary/foreign key of
    each column in the table.

2.  **Explore tab**: In this tab, users will be able to explore the rows
    and columns of the dataset. It provides options for users to see the top or bottom rows and random samples.
    Users can also adjust the number of rows they want to see at a given time.

3.  **Numeric tab**: provides more detailed information of the dataset,
    displaying statistical information of numeric columns. Users will
    be able to select numeric columns to analyze, when expanded,
    several statistical information will be shown such as total unique
    values, missing values, negative values, standard deviation, min/max
    and median values. Histogram will show the
    distribution of the values in the column as well as a table
    containing more detailed information on most frequently found
    values.

4.  **Text tab**: similar to the numeric tab, contains statistical
    information of text columns. Users will also be able to select the
    text columns to analyze and when expanded, statistical information
    shown includes the total number of unique and missing values, lower
    or upper case characters, empty strings and the mode. Barchart is
    used to show the distribution or count of each value in the selected
    column, with more detailed information displayed in the following
    table.

5.  **Date tab**: similar to numeric and text tabs, holds statistical
    details on date time columns in the dataset. Users select columns
    they are interested in and statistical data will be provided such as
    min/max dates, number of weekday/weekend dates, missing/unique
    values and future dates. Barchart is also included to give better
    visuals on the distribution of the values with the details further
    provided in the following table.

## How to Setup

1. Install Docker from www.docker.com

In order for the app to connect to the database, we have to figure out
the connection details including the database name, username that has
access to the database, the password corresponding, the host name, and
the port number. It is also important to make sure that the database has
at least one schema and one table, otherwise, the application will not
be able to produce any result.

## How to Run the Program

Start by clicking on the docker compose file and run the compose up command

From there it should establish both sessions and you log into the ip address 0.0.0.0:8501. If docker does not work, follow below step. If not keep going to connect the database section

**If docker is not working:** Open terminal and run: streamlit run
“pathway”

To connect the database, open the expander widget labeled “Streamlit
application for performing data exploration on a database”:

Then put in all of the postgresql connection details to the form, all of
the details must be accurate, otherwise the connection won’t be
established.

If all of the required information is correct, then clicking the
“connect” button will result in a success message **“Connection to
database established”**.

Once the connection has been established, then a dropdown menu will pop
up containing tables to be choosed. The next step then is to choose the
table that you want to analyze.
